# Functional Programming in Java 

**Introduction**

In this article, we will go over functional programming in Java. For the purpose of the article, it will be assumed that you have foundational knowledge up to Java 7. All the features I will talk about have been introduced in Java 8 onwards.

**What is Functional Programming**

To begin, it is important to have a solid understanding of functional programming and its advantages. Functional Programming is a programming paradigm centered on the structure and use of functions. At the same time, emphasis is put on ensuring the code is safe to use anywhere, even in parallel processes. This is done by the creation of pure functions; functions that don’t cause any global side effects and have consistent outputs for the same input. As well, the use of immutable data structures is recommended to avoid modification of data, which would cause a global side effect. The emphasis on avoiding global side effects makes functional programming ideal for a multi-threaded environment; you don’t have to worry about weird interactions between threads because of the isolated nature of the operations. As well, Functional programming excels at cleanly and efficiently manipulating data, which is important during an age in which data is becoming plentiful and critical for society. This programming paradigm also has the concept of using functions as objects, which was not in Java until version 8. Subsequently, a function that takes other functions as objects is known as a “higher-order function”, which can help condense code in some situations as seen later. This article will focus on the use of functions as objects and higher order functions, as using this aspect is not as intuitive (reword this sentence since beyond 'and' is a bit awkward to read). It is also worth noting that Java technically does not have functions, as functions are not linked to any class or object. Java, being strictly object-oriented, does not have a feature to create a function outside of a class block. Instead, Java has methods, which are identical to functions, but associated with a class or object. For the purposes of this guide, this distinction is not very significant and the terms “function” and “method” may be used interchangeably.

**An Overview of Java’s Support for Functional Programming**

Java was never initally developed to support functional programming. You could definitely create pure functions, and have immutable objects and data structures, but there was no real way to use functions as objects, and subsequently, create higher-order functions. Java 8 however, provided the tools necessary to use these features, which has some applications to help the life of a Java developer. These tools include the introduction of UnmodifiableCollections, the lambda expression, Streams and method reference.

**Unmodifiable Collections**

Ordinary Collections such as Lists are mutable by nature, and so if one is not careful, an unwanted modification can be made. Within the Collections class, there exists many static methods used to create UnmodifiableCollections out of ordinary ones. These static methods take the naming convention of: unmodifiable<CollectionName>, and take the Collection object you wish to make unchangeable. Take the following example:


```java
List<String> strings = Collections.unmodifiableList(new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("Hello", "World")));  
  
strings.add("Illegal");  
  
System.out.println(strings);
```

We convert an otherwise modifiable List into an unmodifiable version. Attempting to run this example would throw UnsupportedOperationException, preventing you from modifying the Collection as attempted here.

Even though an Exception is thrown for adding or removing elements, it is not guaranteed the Collection is immutable. For instance, take the following example (note that the Point Class is from the java.awt package):

```java
Point a = new Point(5,9);  
  
List<Point> points = Collections.unmodifiableList(new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(a)));  
a.setLocation(20,20);  
  
System.out.println(points);
```

Running the code outputs the following:
```
[java.awt.Point[x=20,y=20]]
```

As you can see, an object within the List was modified using a reference pointing to the same object. To ensure that the List is truly immutable, it must only contain objects that are also immutable.

Note Java 9 added a less verbose way to create these immutable Collections, following the basic syntax:

```java
List<String> strings = List.of("Hello", "World");
```
There are many other static methods within the Collections classes of this fashion, such as corresponding methods for Maps and Sets.

**Lambda Expressions**

A lambda expression can be defined as an expression used to create a method in-line. These lambda expressions have object-like qualities in that they are passed into higher-order functions (in fact, they are actually their own objects but that will be explained later). As an example of the syntax of these expressions, say we had this simple method:

```java
public static boolean isEven(int num){
    return num % 2 == 0;
}
```

This same basic logic can be expressed as a lambda expression as follows:

```java
(num) -> { return num % 2 == 0; }
```

The arguments are written with brackets whereas the method body is written within curly brackets, these two separated with a "->".

Since the there is only one argument within the brackets, the expression can be simplified further:

```java
num -> { return num % 2 == 0; }
```

As well, since the method body only contains a return statement, it may be even further simplified:

```java
num -> num % 2 == 0;
```

At this point, you may be wondering why the types of the parameter and returned value are omitted. With Java being a statically typed language, it may not be very intuitive to you why this is the case. Yet, lambda expressions are indeed strongly and statically typed, even though types aren't shown, this will be explained in more detail later.

**Lambda Expressions vs Anonymous Inner Classes**

Lambda expressions, being a way to create “methods” on the fly, draws some comparison to anonymous inner-classes, a way to build objects on the fly (replace one of the 'on to fly' to avoid repitition). To review, anonymous inner-classes are often used to pass event listeners into swing components:

```java
JButton b1 = new JButton("Hello World");

b1.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {

    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
    
        System.out.println("This is pretty cool");
        
    }
    
});
```

With the anonymous inner-class, we create the class in-line as it does not have any re-usability afterwards. Lambda expressions work in almost the exact same way; they are also used to create objects in-line to be used only once, just as the anonymous inner-class. These objects are essentially instances of wrapper classes for the methods we are interested in using. Behind the scenes, lambda expressions are implementations of what are called “functional interfaces”.

**Functional Interfaces**

Functional interfaces are essentially interfaces that contain one unimplemented method. The idea is that they represent a functionality and not some kind of entity. These properties allow the compiler to map lambda expressions into a functional interface.

If you carefully read that description, you will notice that the ActionListener interface follows this description; it has only one method to implement, and it represents a functionality, a response to an action. In that case, you would be completely correct, the ActionListener interface is a functional interface and thus can be passed as a lambda expression:

```java
JButton b1 = new JButton("Hello World");

b1.addActionListener(event -> {
    System.out.println("This is pretty cool");
});
```

Since there is only one method to implement, the only meaningful code is its implementation; the lambda expression allows us to only show the implementation of that one method, removing boilerplate code.

Going back to the question about type safety, the compiler knows that the lambda expression is an implementation of the ActionListener interface, since the addActionListener method expects one. Consequently, it knows that the type of the parameter must be of ActionEvent, as the lambda expression implements a method requiring it. The compiler also knows that the method being implemented has a return type of void. If the implementation was supposed to return a String, the compiler would expect this, even without explicitly saying that it should as with normal methods. Note: functional interfaces often have their argument and return types as generics. In this case the type of the arguments and return value would be specified by the method accepting it.

**Stream api**

One common use of lambda expressions is to be passed into higher order functions to manipulate the values within data structures. It would be impossible to talk about this application without mentioning(?) streams. A stream in this context can be thought of as a conveyor belt; this conveyor belt takes objects from a source, typically some kind of data structure, and then inputs the objects into methods. After interacting with an object in this conveyor belt, you cannot go back to that object and as it has already gone through. Thus, that conveyor belt cannot be used to store objects as they just pass through them to be put into methods. As well, the conveyor belt doesn’t have a capacity as it does not store objects. It is important to note that since the objects from the stream can only be visited once, upon using a stream it cannot be reused. If a stream is accidentally reused an IllegalStateException is thrown.

You may create Streams out of Collections by invoking their stream method. Using the stream, you can perform a variety of operations on the elements within the Collection in a clean way. These streams abide by the principle of not causing any side effects; they do not change the original Collection. They instead gather the data into another source, which is usually a new stream. Methods of the Stream interface can be divided into two categories: intermediate and terminal methods. The intermediate methods return new streams to further manipulate, whereas terminal methods return a final result, or do something with it. As a simple example, the code below takes a list and uses streams to create a new list with all the odd elements removed.


```java
List<Integer> nums = List.of(2, 3, 4, 9, 11, 14, 16);
  
List<Integer> result = nums.stream()  
    .filter(num -> num % 2 == 0)  
    .collect(Collectors.toList());  
  
System.out.println(result);
```

As you can see, using streams for this problem provides a concise solution. First, we create a stream of the list of integers by invoking the stream method, then we invoke the filter method using a simple lambda expression as an argument. This lambda expression implements a functional interface called “Predicate.” The method it implements takes a value (in this case, it is of type integer as are the elements), and returns a boolean. The filter method inputs each element into the method. If false is returned, then the element is removed from the resulting stream. Note that since the intermediate methods return new streams, we can chain methods of the stream interface when performing multiple operations. Each call within the chain manipulates the elements of the resulting stream from the previous call. By convention, we put each method in the chain on their own lines and on separate indentation levels. After calling the filter method, we invoke the collect method with the argument: “Collectors.toList()”, to collect each element in the stream into a new list.

Note: to perform operations asynchronously, invoke the parallelStream method instead of the stream method.

**Some Common Stream Methods**

The Stream interface has a large amount of methods to provide useful tools when manipulating data. Some of the more commonly used methods I will go into detail about are the map, forEach and reduce methods of the Stream interface. If you are interested in learning more about the Stream interface, you should find all you need to know from the documentation.

The map method takes each element from the stream, performs some manipulation specified by the method argument, and then returns a new stream of the resulting values. The resulting values do not have to be of the same type of the original values. There also exists some methods in the Stream interface that behave like the map method, but must return a Stream of a particular type. These methods follow the basic naming convention of: mapTo<DataType>.

The forEach method takes each element of the Stream and expects you to perform some kind of action with each element, such as a method invocation. The return type is void as it is a terminal method.

The reduce method takes each element of the stream, cumulatively performing an operation we define to reduce it into a single result. For example, you may pass a lambda expression to add two elements, returning the result. In this case the reduce method would return the sum of all the elements. Note: the lambda expression passed must take two elements of the stream as arguments.

**Method Reference**

Going back to our description of lambda expressions, a lambda expression is an expression used to create a “method” on the fly. The one drawback is that lambda expressions lack the re-usability of normal methods. The question then arises, what if you had a method you would like to reuse, but also wanted the option to pass it into a higher-order function? To get the best of both worlds, method reference is your best option. With method reference, you can pass ordinarily defined methods into higher-order functions. The basic syntax for method reference is as follows: <Class/ObjectName>::<method>. Instead of using the ordinary dot syntax to reference a method, two colons are used to specify not to call the method. You may even call the constructor of classes using the following structure: <ClassName>::new. This is used to take elements of a stream, input each as constructor arguments, and output a new stream of instances of the corresponding class. As an example, say we had the following Person class:

```java
package com.john.amiscaray.functional.examples.models;  
  
public class Person {  
  
    private String name;  
  
    public Person(String name){  
  
        this.name = name;  
  
    }  
    public String getName() {  
        return name;  
    }  
    public void introduce(){  
  
        System.out.println("Hello my name is " + name);  

    }  
  
}
```

If we had a list of names we wanted to create Person objects out of, and then invoke the introduce method on each of them, we can solve this problem trivially:

```java
List<String> names = List.of("John", "Dane", "Jane");  
  
names.stream()  
    .map(Person::new)  
    .forEach(Person::introduce);
```

Here, we first create a stream out of the list of names, then we call the map method to create Person instances, using each String as the name field. Then we call the forEach method to invoke the introduce method of each Person. 

```java
.forEach(person -> person.introduce());
```

**Summary and Conclusion**

To summarize this article, we went over the basic idea behind functional programming, and some of the tools Java gives us to code in this style. This includes UnmodifiableCollections, functional interfaces, lambda expressions, stream api and method reference. Knowing how to use these tools gives us versatility to code in a functional style, which may be most effective in some scenarios.
